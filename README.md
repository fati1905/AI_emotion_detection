# Information about this program
<p>The program simulates a neural network capable of differentiating people's emotions (sad, happy, angry, surprised, neutral, disugsted). </p>
<p>Since the data used is not clean and clear, the neural network is incapable of converging when using all the classes. Try to use two classes that contain two diffrent emotions. In the program, we used happy and sad classes as they are very diffrent from each other.</p>
